Welcome to Image Simulation Recipes
===================================

A "recipe" is a python script that makes a set of simulated images given 
some basic ingredients. The instructions typically involve the use of 
"utensils," which are re-usable tools for carrying out basic operations. 
You can browse the recipes and admire our utensils by following the links below.
